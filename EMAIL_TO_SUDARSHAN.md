# Email to Sudarshan - AI Food Ordering POC

**Subject:** AI-Powered Food Ordering Integration - POC Demo Ready

---

Hi Sudarshan,

We've completed a proof-of-concept demonstrating AI-powered food ordering integration with ChatGPT. The POC validates three different approaches for integrating our food ordering platform with conversational AI, each with distinct user experiences and implementation paths. All three approaches are **demo-ready** and working with mock data. Please find the attached presentation deck with implementation details, architecture diagrams, and ChatGPT screenshots showing the live demo.

---

## Three Approaches Implemented

### 1. Conversational API Integration (Custom GPT)
- Users order food through natural language conversation in ChatGPT
- Backend API fully implemented and deployed on Vercel
- Handles complex queries like "Get me spicy Indian food under $15 in 20 minutes"
- Intelligent search processes multiple constraints (cuisine, price, delivery time, preferences)
- **Status:** Demo-ready MVP

### 2. Hybrid Approach (GPT + Web App)
- ChatGPT provides intelligent recommendations and search
- Redirects to our web app for menu browsing and checkout
- Combines AI assistance with familiar web UI experience
- **Status:** Demo-ready MVP

### 3. MCP Connector (Interactive UI in ChatGPT)
- Renders clickable buttons and interactive elements directly in ChatGPT
- Uses OpenAI's Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Currently in OpenAI beta/developer mode
- **Status:** Exploring (will update once API is stable)

## Next Steps

**NOMNOM Integration:**
- Current POC uses mock restaurant data (18 restaurants, 5 cities)
- Ready to integrate with NOMNOM API once we have API documentation
- Payment gateway integration to be scoped in next phase

**Demo Access:**

The Custom GPT is currently **private** (not published to GPT Store). Since you're not on our ChatGPT Enterprise domain, I cannot extend direct access to you.

**Options for you:**
1. I can make it **public** (anyone with link can access) - if you're comfortable with that
2. I can **demo it live** for you and the team at your convenience
3. I can create a **video walkthrough** showing all three approaches

Please let me know your preference. I'm available to discuss further or present to stakeholders.
